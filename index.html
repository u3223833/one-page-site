<h1> SPOOKY TALES AND MYTHS BURRIED UNDER THE TOWN OF CANBERRA</h1>

<p>Whether you’re a believer, a skeptic, or flat-out think they’re a myth, ghost stories and "sightings" have perpetuated popular culture for millennia, and some of them are downright spooky.  
  

Many people who are interested in paranormal – or just plain creepy experiences – will usually venture out of their way to find places that are haunted. 
Canberra, however, has a rich hidden history, and with that comes the paranormal. Most born and raised Canberrans would know this region is host to a cornucopia
