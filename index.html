  <h1>SPOOKY TALES AND MYTHS BURRIED UNDER THE TOWN OF CANBERRA</h1>
  <p>Whether you’re a believer, a skeptic, or flat-out think they’re a myth, ghost stories and "sightings" have perpetuated popular culture for millennia, and some of them are downright spooky. 
  
Many people who are interested in paranormal – or just plain creepy experiences – will usually venture out of their way to find places that are haunted. 
Canberra, however, has a rich hidden history, and with that comes the paranormal. 
 
Most born and raised Canberrans would know this region is host to a cornucopia 
of haunted relics, buildings, and "ghost spots" that will give goosebumps even to some disbelievers. Enter Canberra at dusk to hear stories of tragic love and 
defeat, as well as be plagued with ghastly encounters of a more personal nature.  

There are several places in the nation’s capital that are renowned for being haunted, with many locals alleging sightings and recounting the same experiences. 
So here's my list of the "most haunted places" in Canberra, so called as they are either famous for a mysterious presence or places that have been officially recorded as haunted.</p>

   <h1> THE AIR DISASTER MEMEORIAL ('the burning airman') </h1>
    
    <p>The site of a tragic aircraft accident in 1940 has become known as an unsettling, haunted site. A plane went down in Fairbairn Pine Plantation killing all ten people on board. 
    At the site is a commemorative plaque to remember those who lost their lives. The site is interesting in itself, the walk there can fit in your daily steps, but there is another reason that people go. 
    There is something unsettling about venturing into the middle of the bush to a site where a tragedy has occurred. The eerie sign off of Pialligo Avenue immediately sets the tone for the entire experience; unsettling. 
    If you thought the various signs saying not to stray from the path as there is military testing, and touching things may kill you isn’t scary enough, there have also been lots of paranormal experiences. 
    If you decide to drive there via a different route, be sure not to turn your car off, as they have been known to stall and not turn back on. 
    Reports of ‘The Burning Airman’ have been popular since the late 60’s, with visitors saying they have seen a figure who appears to be on fire flash before their eyes.
    The cliché of being in the middle of nowhere with a tragic background definitely makes the site a creepy one, and my number one pick for the capital’s spooky spots.</p>
      
      <p2> Just a short distance from the Canberra Airport sits a memorial for an R.A.A.F. Bomber crash from 1940. Now surrounded by the Fairbairn Pine Plantation, the area has become known for The Burning Airman urban legend. But could this possibly be more than just a legend?
Like most legends, this legend has various versions, but the most common one is:
If you stop your car on the cattle guard, a nurse who was on the scene at the time of the crash helping the wounded will run towards your car and try to get in.
Unlike most other places, this location has more than one legend attached to it. It goes like this:
A young girl was found beneath a cattle guard near the memorial. She had been dead for a short while before her body was found, but none of the ground around the guard was disturbed. If you stop your car within a certain distance from the guard, your car will stall.
When I first began researching these legends, I figured that the location probably wasn’t haunted, but the more information I uncovered, the more I started to question if maybe it was haunted after all.
The Canberra Air Disaster
On the morning of August 13, 1940, a Lockheed Hudson, registration number A16-97 was on the way to Canberra from Melbourne. The weather was sunny and clear, and people had remarked earlier that morning that it was a perfect day for flying. While preparing to land from what had been a normal flight, the plane suddenly nosedived into a field just a mile and a half from the Canberra Aerodrome. The plane immediately burst into flames and while it only took rescuers a couple of minutes to arrive, all ten passengers and crew were beyond hope of rescue.
These ten people included three cabinet ministers, Australia’s top Army general, a lieutenant colonel, a private secretary for the air minister and four R.A.A.F crew members. Not only was this crash a tragedy for all of the family and friends of the men killed, but it was also a tragedy for Australia; the prime minister had just lost some of his closest friends and allies.

One of the odd things about this crash was that for a lot of people, the inquiry into the accident left more questions rather than answers. The biggest one being, who was flying the plane? It’s one of those situations where if the plane had crashed now, it’s highly likely all of these questions would have been answered.
When the fire department and police arrived on scene they thought that maybe there could be survivors so they sent for the local doctor, Dr. Lewis Nott. Incidentally, Dr. Nott did not bring a female nurse with him to assist in possible rescues, but his 10-year-old son. Most likely even before Dr. Nott actually arrived on the scene, the police and fireman realized that a doctor was not going to be necessary.
The bodies were removed from the scene and taken directly to the morgue for identification and autopsy. Despite crime scene photography being used in Australia since the 1920s, no photographs were taken of the location of the bodies before they were removed from the wreckage. The decision to not photograph (or even sketch) the scene with bodies in place, would cause people to question to this day: Who was really flying the plane?  
The man who was supposed to be flying the plane and the man who was blamed for the crash was Robert E. Hitchcock. However, during the inquest hearings rumors began circulating that the Air Minister, James Fairbairn was overheard saying that he was hoping to get a chance to fly the plane during this short trip. While Fairbairn was himself an accomplished pilot, he had not had any flight training on the Hudson which was known to be difficult to fly and stalled easily. 
It would have been very easy to solve the mystery of whether or not Minister Fairbairn had been flying. Due to an old injury, Fairbairn’s right arm was noticeably shorter than his left. Did one of the bodies found in the cockpit have a disfigured right arm? There was also the question of why the plane sat at the runway waiting to take off for an additional 10 minutes after it had been cleared for takeoff. Officials at the time stated it was because it was “warming up”, however the plane had just recently completed a flight and no warm-up would have been necessary. Speculation arose that it was during this time that Minister Fairbairn changed seats with the co-pilot, Richard Wisener.
The outcome of the inquest was that Hitchcock, who had over 100 hours of flying experience had fatally stalled the plane in perfect flying conditions. Despite not only landing the plane just a short time earlier and also landing a Hudson in very similar conditions in Canberra previously.
Another oddity about the inquest is the causes of death. Even though the plane practically pancaked onto the ground, many people suggested the crash would have been survivable for many had it not immediately burst into flames. The cause of death listed on the death certificates is exactly the same for all of the men: Fractured Skulls.  The coroner’s report was exactly the same for all men, only the names were changed. His opinion was that all men died instantly before the plane caught fire.
I find it odd that every man would’ve died from a skull fracture. The plane was not instantly disintegrated upon impact. According to an August 14, 1940 article in The Argus “Officials who examined the wreckage are certain that it was very little damaged in the landing, and that had the fire not occurred, the occupants would have escaped.” It seems perhaps it was easier on the coroner to tell the families of these men that they died instantly from skull fractures, and not that they died a horrible death from smoke inhalation and fire after the initial crash.
When I first read about this legend, I immediately had a mental image of a man who was killed in the crash but didn’t realize he was dead. He simply got up and ran out of the plane, on fire, and now a ghost. 
While none of the men made it out of the plane alive, at least two of the bodies were found towards the back of the plane, in the aisle. Had they been thrown there on impact, or had they tried to make it off the plane and been overcome by smoke and fire?
I believe that ghosts are usually some type of energy imprint that’s left behind. This energy then replaying over and over again, usually of either the last moment’s of the person’s life or something that the person would do regularly.

      <h2> Strange Occurrences </h2>
      
      <p>On the twenty-year anniversary of the crash, a monument was erected at the site by the previous Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. It’s not clear if the reports of the spectral burning airman happened before the memorial was erected.
The area became known as a popular make-out spot before the road leading to the memorial was closed. People that were in the area reported seeing “unearthly lights” that would flash in an old dirt parking lot next to the memorial.  As if the strange lights weren’t creepy enough, there are reports of a ghostly figure dashing across the road, sometimes shrouded in flames.

      <h3> But That’s Not The Only Mystery Here...</h3>
      
      <p> Like other legends, these tales of strange activity never seem to have any dates or names attached to them. They’re always anonymously shared in the vaguest of terms. However, unlike other legends, tied to a specific location, this location has seen more than one tragic event.
On the evening of February 26, 1971, a 20-year-old woman named Keren Rowland went missing. She was supposed to meet her sister at a party but never arrived. Her car was found the following day on the side of Parkes Way road with no gas.
Witnesses reported seeing a dark car near Keren’s car on the night in question and said a woman fitting Keren’s description was walking towards the car. The same car was spotted speeding past the Canberra airport towards Queanbeyan about 10-15 minutes later. Despite witness descriptions of the vehicle, the driver of the car was never identified. Keren’s father told police that she had just been through a broken engagement and was approximately 5 months pregnant. 

Months passed with no sign of Keren. Her parents conducted an exhaustive search and no real leads turned up. Finally, on May 13th, 1971, the skeletal remains of Keren Rowland were found at the Canberra Disaster Memorial by a hiker. 
Police believe that Keren was killed elsewhere and then her body was dumped at the memorial site later. But why leave her body at a location that people visit? Despite her pregnancy having been confirmed in November 1970 by her physician, there was no evidence of a fetus when her body was found. 
To this day, almost 50 years later, there have been no arrests in the murder of Keren Rowland, and her death remains unsolved.
Interestingly enough, people have reported seeing a young woman standing near the edge of the clearing at the Canberra Disaster Memorial. She is said to be wearing slightly outdated clothing, with long brown hair that is pulled up.
Friends and family have stated that Keren almost always wore her hair down, but on the night that she disappeared she was wearing her hair up.
Could the strange sightings and activity at the Canberra Disaster Memorial be connected to these two tragic events, or is it simply an urban legend?

     <h1> BLUNDELLS COTTAGE ('Flora') </h1>

   
      <p>This cottage next to Lake Burley Griffin is a classic for locals when it comes to haunted spots around Canberra. 
      Built-in 1860, Blundell’s Cottage was home to the Ginn family, then later passed onto George Blundell and his family. 
      The cottage had multiple other residents, but coined the name Blundell since the family lived in there the longest; 59 years from 1874-1933. 
      The paranormal presence that many visitors seem to encounter at Blundell’s is believed to be that of the eldest Blundell child, Flora. 
      Voices and a ‘burning’ smell are present in the house. This can be linked to the story of Flora. 
      When she lived there she got too close to the fireplace and accidentally caught fire. 
      Visitors have sworn to hear her ‘scream’ accompanied with a scent of burning.</p>

   <h1>HOTEL KURRAJONG ('The Ghost of Chifley')</h1>
    
      <p>This luxurious hotel located in Barton is loved for it’s lush interior, fancy functions such as high tea, and amazing food from their bar & grill. 
      However, this hotel is hiding something more ominous. Australia’s 16th prime minister, Ben Chifley, lived in his own room for 11 years at the hotel.
      One night, he suffered a heart attack and passed away in that very room. 
      The hotel offers The Chifley Experience, where guests can book his room overnight and experience how Chifley lived. 
      Many people who have stayed at the hotel have reported seeing a figure they believe to be the ghost of Chifley, walking around in a grey suit and often near various balconies and windows. 
      Even without seeing or hearing anything, this experience is still eerie. If you want to experience staying in the room and potentially seeing the ghost of Chifley, the room is always available for bookings.</p>

   <h1>DUNTROON HOUSE ('Sophia Susanna Campbell')</h1>
    
    <p>This building is the oldest in Canberra, built in 1833, which already hints at a spooky aspect. The house has a special place in the Australian Army’s heritage as it served many purposes, but is now used as the Officer’s Mess at the Royal Military College. 
  But, with it’s rich history comes a haunted one, too. The ghost that resides here is one of  Canberra’s most well known ones, believed to be Sophia Susanna Campbell, granddaughter of Robert Campbell, who built the house back in 1833. 
  She died after falling from her room’s window in 1885, although many still speculate over whether it was accidental or deliberate. Her presence is very active at this site, with numerous reports of sightings and activity believed to be from Sophia, such as a messy room and ruffled bed. 
  She has been seen in the very room that is speculated on, through hallways, and wandering in the gardens.</p>
