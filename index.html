  <h1><center>SPOOKY TALES AND MYTHS BURRIED UNDER THE TOWN OF CANBERRA</center></h1>

<p1>Whether you’re a believer, a skeptic, or flat-out think they’re a myth, ghost stories and "sightings" have perpetuated popular culture for millennia, and some of them are downright spooky. 
Many people who are interested in paranormal – or just plain creepy experiences – will usually venture out of their way to find places that are haunted. 
Canberra, however, has a rich hidden history, and with that comes the paranormal. 
<br>
Most born and raised Canberrans would know this region is host to a cornucopia 
of haunted relics, buildings, and "ghost spots" that will give goosebumps even to some disbelievers. Enter Canberra at dusk to hear stories of tragic love and 
defeat, as well as be plagued with ghastly encounters of a more personal nature.  
<br>
<br>
There are several places in the nation’s capital that are renowned for being haunted, with many locals alleging sightings and recounting the same experiences. 
So here's my list of the "most haunted places" in Canberra, so called as they are either famous for a mysterious presence or places that have been officially recorded as haunted.

   <h1> - The Air Disaster Memorial - </h1>
   <h2 style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"> 'THE BURNING AIR MAN'</h2>
     
    <p>The site of a tragic aircraft accident in 1940 has become known as an unsettling, haunted site. A plane went down in Fairbairn Pine Plantation killing all ten people on board. 
    At the site is a commemorative plaque to remember those who lost their lives. The site is interesting in itself, the walk there can fit in your daily steps, but there is another reason that people go. 
    There is something unsettling about venturing into the middle of the bush to a site where a tragedy has occurred. The eerie sign off of Pialligo Avenue immediately sets the tone for the entire experience; unsettling. 
    If you thought the various signs saying not to stray from the path as there is military testing, and touching things may kill you isn’t scary enough, there have also been lots of paranormal experiences. 
    If you decide to drive there via a different route, be sure not to turn your car off, as they have been known to stall and not turn back on. 
    Reports of ‘The Burning Airman’ have been popular since the late 60’s, with visitors saying they have seen a figure who appears to be on fire flash before their eyes.
    The cliché of being in the middle of nowhere with a tragic background definitely makes the site a creepy one, and my number one pick for the capital’s spooky spots.</p>
      
      <p> Like most legends, this legend has various versions, but the most common one is:
If you stop your car on the cattle guard, a nurse who was on the scene at the time of the crash helping the wounded will run towards your car and try to get in.
Unlike most other places, this location has more than one legend attached to it. It goes like this:
A young girl was found beneath a cattle guard near the memorial. She had been dead for a short while before her body was found, but none of the ground around the guard was disturbed. If you stop your car within a certain distance from the guard, your car will stall.

    <h2 style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"> STRANGE OCCURANCES..... </h2>
      
      <p>On the twenty-year anniversary of the crash, a monument was erected at the site by the previous Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. It’s not clear if the reports of the spectral burning airman happened before the memorial was erected.
The area became known as a popular make-out spot before the road leading to the memorial was closed. People that were in the area reported seeing “unearthly lights” that would flash in an old dirt parking lot next to the memorial.  As if the strange lights weren’t creepy enough, there are reports of a ghostly figure dashing across the road, sometimes shrouded in flames.
      </p>
      
      <p> Like other legends, these tales of strange activity never seem to have any dates or names attached to them. They’re always anonymously shared in the vaguest of terms. However, unlike other legends, tied to a specific location, this location has seen more than one tragic event.
On the evening of February 26, 1971, a 20-year-old woman named Keren Rowland went missing. She was supposed to meet her sister at a party but never arrived. Her car was found the following day on the side of Parkes Way road with no gas.
Witnesses reported seeing a dark car near Keren’s car on the night in question and said a woman fitting Keren’s description was walking towards the car. The same car was spotted speeding past the Canberra airport towards Queanbeyan about 10-15 minutes later. Despite witness descriptions of the vehicle, the driver of the car was never identified. Keren’s father told police that she had just been through a broken engagement and was approximately 5 months pregnant. 

Months passed with no sign of Keren. Her parents conducted an exhaustive search and no real leads turned up. Finally, on May 13th, 1971, the skeletal remains of Keren Rowland were found at the Canberra Disaster Memorial by a hiker. 
Police believe that Keren was killed elsewhere and then her body was dumped at the memorial site later. But why leave her body at a location that people visit? Despite her pregnancy having been confirmed in November 1970 by her physician, there was no evidence of a fetus when her body was found. 
To this day, almost 50 years later, there have been no arrests in the murder of Keren Rowland, and her death remains unsolved.
       <br>
       <br>
Interestingly enough, people have reported seeing a young woman standing near the edge of the clearing at the Canberra Disaster Memorial. She is said to be wearing slightly outdated clothing, with long brown hair that is pulled up.
Friends and family have stated that Keren almost always wore her hair down, but on the night that she disappeared she was wearing her hair up.
Could the strange sightings and activity at the Canberra Disaster Memorial be connected to these two tragic events, or is it simply an urban legend?

       <h1> - Blundells Cottage -  </h1>
       <h2 style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">'FLORA' </h2> 

      <p>This cottage next to Lake Burley Griffin is a classic for locals when it comes to haunted spots around Canberra. 
      Built-in 1860, Blundell’s Cottage was home to the Ginn family, then later passed onto George Blundell and his family. 
      The cottage had multiple other residents, but coined the name Blundell since the family lived in there the longest; 59 years from 1874-1933. 
      The paranormal presence that many visitors seem to encounter at Blundell’s is believed to be that of the eldest Blundell child, Flora. 
       <br>
       <br>
      Voices and a ‘burning’ smell are present in the house. This can be linked to the story of Flora. 
      When she lived there she got too close to the fireplace and accidentally caught fire. 
      Visitors have sworn to hear her ‘scream’ accompanied with a scent of burning.
       <br>
       <br>
       The staff that man the little museum talk about odd things that happen in cottage, including items being mysteriously moved overnight to unexplained feelings of someone watching you and even more unnerving, the smell of burning human flesh. Bizarrely it is said that only people wearing a necklace can feel the presence of this spirit which probably explains why I have never seen or felt anything whenever I have visited the place. And the reason for this? It is said that Flora was wearing a necklace, maybe a favourite one, when she died.</p>

       <p> HAUNTED BY: The apparition of a teenage girl playing in the English gardens around this historic rubble-stone relic from the mid-1800s is thought by paranormal investigators to be the ghost of Florrie Blundell, who died in 1892 at the age of 16 as a result of burns sustained in an ironing accident.</p> 
       <br>
       <p>RECENT SIGHTINGS: Last month, several visitors to the heritage-listed cottage - now a museum - reported being overcome with the "disturbing odour of burning human flesh".</p>
       <br>
       <p>SCARE FACTOR: Medium, far from a malevolent spirit, several spiritualists claim Florrie actually enjoys visitors.</p>

   <h1> - Hotel Kurrajong -  </h1>
   <h2 style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"> 'THE GHOST OF CHIFLEY' </h2>
      <p>This luxurious hotel located in Barton is loved for it’s lush interior, fancy functions such as high tea, and amazing food from their bar & grill. 
      However, this hotel is hiding something more ominous. Australia’s 16th prime minister, Ben Chifley, lived in his own room for 11 years at the hotel.
      One night, he suffered a heart attack and passed away in that very room. 
       <br>
       <br>
      The hotel offers The Chifley Experience, where guests can book his room overnight and experience how Chifley lived. 
      Many people who have stayed at the hotel have reported seeing a figure they believe to be the ghost of Chifley, walking around in a grey suit and often near various balconies and windows. The Ghost of Ben Chifley is said to still haunt Hotel Kurrajong, people have seen this man walking about the hotel. He is often seen pointing towards the parliament house.
      Even without seeing or hearing anything, this experience is still eerie. If you want to experience staying in the room and potentially seeing the ghost of Chifley, the room is always available for bookings.</p>

   <h1> - Duntroon House - </h1>
   <h2 style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"> 'SOPHIA SUSANNA CAMPBELL'</h2>
<p>Built in 1833 (which already hints at a spooky aspect) by Robert Campbell, Duntroon House is the oldest building in Canberra. The house has a special place in the Australian Army’s heritage as it served many purposes, but is now used as the Officer’s Mess at the Royal Military College. But, with it’s rich history comes a haunted one, too.
<br>
<p>  HAUNTED BY: The ghost that resides here is one of  Canberra’s most well known ones, believed to be Sophia Susanna Campbell, granddaughter of Robert Campbell, who built the house back in 1833. This room, on the first floor, once belonged to Sophia who, on May 31, 1885, died after apparently falling from the room's window, although many still speculate over whether it was accidental or deliberate. 
During the 1970s, college residents began to report glimpses of a glowing ghost of a young woman in 19th century period costume. Soon after, some residents also complained that a bed, freshly made in the morning, would be found in as if it had been slept in later in the day, with pillows hurled around the room.</p>
<p> 
Her presence is very active at this site, with numerous reports of sightings and activity believed to be from Sophia, such as a messy room and ruffled bed. She has been seen in the very room that is speculated on, through hallways, and wandering in the gardens.
<br>
<p>RECET SIGHTINGS: Earlier this month, Angela Binos of Isabella Plains snapped a photo of what appears to be a face near a tree in the gardens of Duntroon House. "The afternoon I took that photo I visited my son who works at Duntroon Car Care," reports Binos, adding, "he wanted to show me the gardens so we took a walk over there and took the photo." Binos didn't look at the photo until later that night, but when she did, confesses, "it immediately freaked me out!"</p>
<br>
<p>SCARE FACTOR: High, several top brass of the military refuse to stay in Sophia's former room.</p>
