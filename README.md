DEVELOPER NOTES 

I found it difficult to find the layout and animations the website required. I also ran into issues when I tried to use JavaScript throughout my code. I experimented with several different strategies until I came across one that I felt I could succeed with (flashlight cursor). This effect was supposed to complete my webpage and totally match the theme, but it didn't work out. The issue in this case was that the flash would not follow the mouse; instead, it would either cause everything to vanish or remain in a fixed position. I made numerous attempts to achieve this effect, but none of them were successful. I left the code in there in the hopes of getting feedback on itâ€”what was needed and what I should add. 

I've had some successes in between some of my failures. I added a mouseEvent button property and a cool fading text effect to a few page elements. There is still some, even though it is not much. I was able to make a navigation bar that allows users to press on specific areas of the page. I wish I had focused more on what I should be including and how I could accomplish those things rather than spending so much time researching information on the subject and worrying about how it would look. I noticed that I was hurrying through the coding portion because I was more concerned about the presentation and content. 

As I wasn't able to include as many interactive elements/effects, I added gifs to the webpage to give it some life. 
Overall, I'm ok with some aspects of my one-page website. I only regret not dedicating more time to coding.
