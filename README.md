DEVELOPER NOTES 
the technical things I learned:
Throughout this assignment i had many challenges, fails and sucesses. I sucsesfully applied multiple text effects and a scroller effect which was extreamly difficult as it moved around alot of things and it wouldnt work the way i wanted it to. 

the amount of time you spent on the assignment:
i spend way more time on this project than i should have, i struggled quite a bit trying to get the right layout and animations that the website needed. Another trouble of mine was trying to apply javascript throughout my code. I tried several different approaches until i found one that i thought i could acheive (flashlight cursor). i thought this effect would compleate my webpage, matching the theme 100%, yet also had troubles - trying every single solution i could think of. the problem was that the flash wouldnt follow the mouse, it would make every thing dissapeer, or it made everything white. you can probobly tell me what the issue is right now reading this but i tried. 


the problems you encountered (e.g., cooperation among the group members, designing test cases, debugging, code integration)
